How to Sketch
<p>
A sketch artist attempts to quickly draw a subject onto paper as fast as possible.  They also rarely use solid lines when sketching.  Typically a sketch artist will draw with a free flowing hand to form curves.  A true sketch artist is not afraid to mark up the paper.  If a line doesn't look correct, they just redraw it without worrying about erasing errors.  To a sketch artist, erasing during the beginning stages of a drawing only wastes time and slows down momentum.  
<p>
When drawing, try to think like a sketch artist.  Instead of drawing a solid outline of the subject, attempt to quickly sketch its basic shape.  Make sure to press down lightly on the paper as most of these lines will either be erased or darkened later.  Once the basic form is sketched, start to add more curves to the drawing to define other parts of the object.  
<p>
After the basic dimensions of the object are drawn, start adding *shadows*. Sketch the darkest parts of the object first and move toward the lighter areas.  Remember to create boundaries with *shadows* not solid lines.
<p>
The next step is to start *shading and blending*.  Basically try to merge the dark shadowy areas with the more light areas.  Try to make the transition from dark to light as smooth as possible.  If shading and blending are performed properly, a sketch will appear realistic.
<p>
The last step is sketch in any final details.  *Erase* any unwanted curves, lines, or *smudges*.  Then sign your initials, prop up the sketch, and admire your masterpiece!

Shading and Light Sources: A Tutorial for Sketching or Drawing
<p>
The objective of this lesson is to learn how to use the technique of shading when drawing or sketching.  We will also introduce the concept of light sources and describe how they affect a sketch. 
<p>
Project A: Draw a cube using only shading.
<p>
* Tip - Only use shading when working on this project.  Try not to draw or sketch any lines or curves.
<p>
Materials: pencil, eraser, and printer paper.
<p>
Step 1:  Pick the direction of a light source on the paper.  The light source in Figure F1 is designated by a light bulb.  The arrows are a guide for where light would travel.  The side the cube that faces the light source will be shaded the lightest (Side A) while the side opposite will be shaded the darkest (Side C).
<p>
Step 2: Shade the lightest side.  Press down softly on the paper and move your hand quickly back and forth.  Try to keep the same amount of pressure on the paper at all times so that the shading looks uniform.  Make sure the sketch strokes are all going in the same direction.  
<p>
Step 3: Shade the next side darker then the first.  Press down with medium pressure and like before sketch the strokes in the same direction.  In Figure F1 the direction of shading on Side B goes against the shading on Side A.  Shading against the grain creates depth and strengthens the boundaries between the two sides.  
<p>
Step 4:  Shade the last side.  This side does not have a direct light-source so shade it the darkest.  As before, pay attention to keeping the shading uniform.  
<p>
Step 5:  Clean up the drawing.  *Erase* any rouge lines or smudges.  
<p>
*Tip - Using a scrap piece of paper, cover up the drawing so that only the very edge is showing.  Use the scrap paper as a shield when erasing errors.  This also helps you create a straight edge.

Project B: Draw a sphere or ball using only shading.
<p>
* Tip - Only use shading when working on this project.  Try not to draw or sketch any lines or curves.
<p>
Materials: pencil, eraser, and printer paper.
<p>
Step 1:  Pick the direction of a light source on the paper.  The light-source in Figure F2 is designated by a light bulb.  The arrows are a guide for where light would travel.  The side the sphere that faces the light source will be shaded the lightest (Side A) while the side opposite will be shaded the darkest (Side B).
<p>
Step 2:  Sketch a round circle on the paper.  Make sure you draw this shape lightly with little pressure.  
<p>
Step 3:  Start shading the side furthest from the light-source.  This side should be shaded darker then the rest of the picture.  Using a free flowing but steady hand movement and start drawing from the outer edge and move toward the center of the sphere.  As you move toward the center, start to use less pressure on the pencil and shade lighter.  Also make sure the transition from dark to light is blended well to create the illusion of depth.  
<p>
Step 4:  Start shading the side closest to the light source.  This side should be shaded the lightest and should meet a mid-tone at the center of the sphere.  Blending the transition from light to dark is the most important part of this technique.  
<p>
Step 5:  Clean up the drawing.  *Erase* any rouge marks or smudges.
<p>
<p>
<p>
Homework:  Try to apply these techniques to other drawings.  I listed a few optional objects or sketch subjects for you to practice on.
<p>
1. A House (Cube example)
2. An Apple (Sphere example)
3. A Jar or can (Sphere example)
